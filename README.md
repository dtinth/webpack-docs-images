Let’s make webpack docs better!

A lot of people find webpack’s documentation to be not quite beginners friendly.
This resulted in many webpack-related articles, scattered throughout the internet.

Why not make the webpack docs _itself_ better, together? This is my attempt.

Here’s my comments on the current webpack docs:

- __Too example-guided.__
  A code example or two is enough for me to understand what’s going on, but that is not the case for everyone.
  [Different people have different learning styles](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/tips-students/self-knowledge/understanding-your-learning-style).

- __Too much text.__
  Sometimes a simple diagram is better than text in explaining concepts.

This repository contains the images that I contributed to webpack’s docs (which is a [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki) that anyone can edit).
The `source.sketch` contains the source files in sketch.
All images are generated from this file.

## Image guidelines

- Try to follow webpack docs site’s color schemes and fonts.

- All images are 700px wide to fit nicely with GitHub Wiki’s layouts. (Exported as 1400px for retina displays.)
